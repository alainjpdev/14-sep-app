              Kim Kardashian and her siblings were on Kris Jenner\'s \'Nice\' list this Christmas.
              
              The SKIMS founder, 41, showed off the lavish holiday gifts the Keeping Up with the 
              Kardashians matriarch, 66, gave the Kardashian-Jenner kids over the weekend on 
              Instagram on Monday: brand-new electric MOKE cars in an array of colors, including
               various shades of pink, yellow, orange, and more.
              
               \'Oh my god, look at our Christmas presents from my mom! For all of her kids. How cool
               ! Oh, this has to be Kourtney and Travis, for sure,\' Kim said in an Instagram Story, 
               panning the camera over to a white MOKE car with a skull on the hood. 
              
               \'KhloÃ© and I got the pink ones!\' the reality star added. Jenner also reposted the
                video to her own Instagram Story."
